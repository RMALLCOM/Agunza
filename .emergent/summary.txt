The trajectory details the iterative development of an airport luggage validation kiosk application, initially as a full-stack web application (React, FastAPI, MongoDB), then a significant pivot to a PyQt5 desktop application project structure, before reverting to focus on the web UI. The AI engineer successfully implemented core features like a welcome screen, a multi-step setup wizard, a scanning interface with simulated YOLO detection and weight measurement, validation logic, a payment flow, and internationalization (ES/EN). Key challenges involved refining UI responsiveness, especially for buttons and text alignment across different screen sizes and languages, and precise routing/navigation. The AI also generated a complete PyQt5 project structure based on a detailed specification, although active development for this part was paused. The most recent efforts have centered on correcting button labels, i18n consistency, and ensuring harmonious UI layouts in the web application.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an airport luggage validation kiosk application (JetSMART) with a 15-inch fullscreen touch interface. Key features include a clean, minimal UI with airline-adaptable colors and logo, and dual language support (Spanish/English).

The core flow is:
1.  **Welcome Screen**: Airline logo/background, INICIAR button.
2.  **Setup/Configurator (Configurador de Vuelos)**: A multi-step wizard (initially single screen, then evolved to 4 steps in PyQt5 spec, but simplified in current web app) to configure operator name, boarding gate (ComboBox: A1-A5), flight number (ComboBox: JAT36-JAT56), destination (ComboBox: Name-CODE), and international/national flight. This data must be saved for interactions. Accessible via initial flow or hidden triple-tap hotspot.
3.  **Scan Menu (Comenzar Escaneo)**: Main entry after setup, always returned to after a flow. Shows ESCANEAR button. In earlier iterations, it also had a menu with options like Maleta no permitida, Pesaje libre, Entrenamiento IA. This screen has the language toggle visible.
4.  **Scanning (Escaneo)**: Live camera view (simulated), YOLO overlay (bounding box for luggage, backpack, etc.), side card with simulated dimensions (width/length in cm) and weight (kg). Buttons: VOLVER, ESCANEAR.
5.  **Validation (Validación)**: Displays Cumple (green: Autorizado para embarque. ¡Buen viaje!) or No cumple (red: with error details e.g., Excede ancho 3.2 cm).
    *   If Cumple: Navigates to Despedida.
    *   If No cumple: Offers POR QUÉ NO CUMPLE? (to a detail page) and CONTINUAR AL PAGO (to tariffs).
6.  **Why Page (Detalle de no cumplimiento)**: Shows detailed reasons for non-compliance, current measurements, active rules, and an image of allowed luggage with dimensions. Includes VOLVER and CONTINUAR AL PAGO buttons.
7.  **Tariffs & Payment (Tarifas y Pago)**: Shows breakdown (excess weight, excess dimensions, total), payment methods (debit/credit card, QR - simulated), payment status (approved/rejected), and a PAGAR button. After approval, FINALIZAR button appears.
8.  **Goodbye (Despedida)**: Closing message (Gracias por usar el validador. Buen viaje) and auto-returns to Scan Menu after 3 seconds.

Additional Flows:
*   **Pesaje libre**: Simple screen showing large simulated weight.
*   **Entrenamiento IA**: Admin access to dataset manager (import images, label, train YOLO - all simulated).
*   **Admin Panel**: Configure rules/tariffs, flow editor, train AI, audit logs, operator management (requested in initial spec, not yet implemented in web app).

Design UI: Kiosk aesthetic (large buttons, clear texts), multi-background support, specific layout zones.
Technical Requirements: 100% offline data, USB camera/scale/POS connectivity (simulated), use UUIDs, ISO timestamps, FastAPI backend, React frontend, MongoDB. Later, a full PyQt5 project export was requested, generated, and then web development continued.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture consisting of a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


**Detailed Directory Structure and Key Files:**


-   : Python dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, pymongo, python-dotenv, motor, etc.).
-   : Main FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance**: Defines all backend API endpoints, handles database interactions, and business logic.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Initial setup of , , , , , .
        -   Added  (POST/GET) for flight configuration data.
        -   Added  (POST) for logging system events.
        -   Added demo endpoints for scale:  (GET),  (GET).

-   This directory contains a complete PyQt5 project structure (main.py, screens/, services/, widgets/, config/, assets/, i18n.py, requirements.txt) generated by the AI but not actively used or run within the current environment. It serves as an exportable desktop application. This project uses a QStackedWidget for navigation and defines stubs for camera, YOLO, scale, and validation services.

The architecture emphasizes modularity with clear separation of concerns (frontend/backend, UI components, services) and adherence to environment variable usage for configuration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI was focused on resolving UI inconsistencies and i18n issues reported by the user, specifically related to the NO CUMPLE validation screen and the Tarifas y Pago screen.

The user reported:
1.  **Button Layout Issues**: los botones de medi, pot que y continuar al pago, se sobreponen en difernetes tamaños, deben ajustarse al tamaño que tenga la ventana. (Chat 303), followed by los botones en pantalla completa no se ajustan, arregla este problema (Chat 309), and los botones que agregaste quiero que se ubiqyuen en horizontal. no en vertical (Chat 275).
    *   **AI's Action**: The AI implemented a responsive grid () using  to ensure buttons adjust gracefully to different screen sizes without overlapping or causing scrollbars. Buttons now maintain a harmonious horizontal alignment.
2.  **i18n Issues**: el boton volver a medir no cambia de idioma, todo el detalle de no cumplimiento no cambia de idioma, tarifas y pagos n cambia de idioma (Chat 401).
    *   **AI's Action**: The AI made a corrección completa de i18n for the Volver a medir button (now ), the Detalle de no cumplimiento (WhyPage) screen, and the Tarifas y Pago screen. All relevant texts and labels on these screens are now linked to the global language state ().
3.  **Button Visibility/Labels on Validation**: eliminaste el boton de proceder al pago, y porque , esos debes dejarlos y eliminar el de continuar (Chat 431).
    *   **AI's Action**: The AI removed the single CONTINUAR button for NO CUMPLE state and restored POR QUÉ? and CONTINUAR AL PAGO buttons, maintaining the horizontal, responsive layout.
4.  **Label Change**: cambialo a porque no cumple (Chat 435).
    *   **AI's Action**: The AI confirmed the change to POR QUÉ NO CUMPLE?.

The final interaction before the summary request (Chat 435) also includes the user reporting y el finalizar me dio error (the finish button gave an error), which has not been explicitly addressed by the AI's subsequent confirmed actions.
